Flow chart to learn about DevOps :

1) Basic understanding of DevOps -
 - what is DevOps
 - CI/CD
 - Automation
 - collaboration between devlopment and operation teams.
 - DevOps Prineciple - Communication , collaboration, integration and automation
 - DevOps lifeCycle - Plan, code,Build,test , relese,deploy,operate and monitor
 - Version control : Git and github / Gitlab/bitbucket
 - Microservices and how they relate to devops
 - Monitoting and Logging

2) Version control (git)

3) **Step 3: Learn the Basics of Cloud Computing**
A lot of DevOps practices involve working in the cloud, so you should have a foundational understanding of cloud computing.

**Cloud Platforms:**
* Start with **AWS** (Amazon Web Services) â€” the most widely used platform.
* Learn basic services: EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, Lambda, RDS.
* Optionally, explore other platforms like Azure or Google Cloud.

4) **Step 4: Learn Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
CI/CD is one of the core DevOps practices. You need to understand how to automate the software development pipeline to speed up releases.

1) CI/CD Tools:

* Jenkins: Learn how to set up Jenkins pipelines.
* GitLab CI or GitHub Actions: Learn how to automate CI/CD using these tools.
* CircleCI, Travis CI, and others.

2) Pipeline Concepts:

* Automating build, test, and deploy processes.
* Writing pipeline configuration files (YAML).
* Integrating with version control systems like Git.

## Step 5: Learn Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

IaC is another core principle of DevOps. It allows you to automate the setup of infrastructure using code rather than manual processes.

### Tools to Learn:
- **Terraform**: A popular tool for automating infrastructure deployment.
- **AWS CloudFormation**: AWS-specific IaC tool.
- **Ansible**: For configuration management and automation.

### Basic Concepts:
- Writing and deploying infrastructure code.
- Provisioning servers, networks, and storage resources automatically.
---

## Step 6: Learn Containerization & Orchestration

Containers are central to DevOps workflows, as they provide consistency across different environments (development, testing, production).

### Docker:
- Learn how to create and manage containers using Docker.
- Understand Dockerfiles, images, and containers.
- Learn how to use Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications.

### Kubernetes:
- Understand what Kubernetes is and how it works (orchestration).
- Learn how to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications in Kubernetes.
- Learn how to use Kubernetes with cloud services (AWS EKS, Google Kubernetes Engine).
---

## Step 7: Automate Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring and logging are critical to DevOps because they provide insights into the performance of applications and infrastructure.

### Tools to Learn:
- **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for logging and analysis.
- **Datadog**, **Splunk**, or **New Relic**.

### Concepts:
- Collecting and visualizing metrics.
- Setting up alerts for infrastructure health.
- Centralized logging and log analysis.
---

## Step 8: Advanced DevOps Concepts

Once you have a good understanding of the core DevOps tools, you can explore more advanced topics to deepen your expertise.

### Advanced CI/CD Pipelines:
- Automating more complex deployment workflows.
- Integrating security into CI/CD pipelines (DevSecOps).
- Multi-cloud environments.

### Serverless Architectures:
- Learn about serverless computing and AWS Lambda.
- Integrating serverless with DevOps workflows.

### DevSecOps: Security in DevOps:
- Integrate security into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Learn about vulnerability scanning, secret management, and compliance automation.
---

## Step 9: Build Projects & Hands-on Experience

The key to mastering DevOps is practice. Try to build end-to-end projects using the tools you've learned.

- Create a simple **CI/CD pipeline** using Jenkins/GitLab.
- Deploy a **multi-container application** with Docker and Kubernetes.
- Use **Terraform** to create an infrastructure on AWS.
- Set up **monitoring** with Prometheus and Grafana.
---

## Step 10: Certifications (Optional, But Helpful)

Once you're comfortable with the concepts and tools, you can pursue certifications to validate your knowledge:

- **AWS Certified DevOps Engineer**.
- **Docker Certified Associate**.
- **Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)**.
- **HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate**.
